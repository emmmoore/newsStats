# Ideas

My current plans to develop this library include the following, but please feel free to add any suggestions.

- Creating a class that can filter out all of the "filler" words and terms from the string that contains the HTML content of the webpage (think "and," "a," "the," etc.)
- Developing an algorithm that can identify and sort the important terms, such as names, phrases, and places

Possible Ideas:
- Automatically retrieve references, such as Wikipedia articles, about identified key words.
- Retrieve sentences/phrases in which certain words were used
- Use open source plagiarism checkers, such as [Sherlock](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/research/ias/software/sherlock/), to compare articles.
- Rank the different articles with respect to the frequency of which the keywords appear. 
- Collect key words for each categorization. 
- Create tags of the article using frequently used words
- Create an output file with useful information from the websites and also formatted in a clear manner for the users. 
- Check the credibility of a certain article, assessing from the number of times it has been edited in the past, the number of references it uses, and the number of times it has been cited by others.
